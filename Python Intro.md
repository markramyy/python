## Learning A Language :

- In order for any programmer to learn a language there are **Four key things** that you need to really master for any sort of language including python.

1. **Terms(syntax)**: Sometimes a programming language has different words and different definitions for these words that you're going to have to memorize, things like statements, variables, instantiation.

2. **Data Types**: In programming we have these data types to store information and each programming language has different sort of data types.

3. **Actions**: At the end of the day all programming is is a way for us to tell our machines Hey store this data and then retrieve this data and perform some action on it.

4. **Best Practices**: There's good ways of writing Python code and then there's bad ways so that when we build our applications our programs while we don't have a leaning tower like this but we have a solid structure and a solid program.
