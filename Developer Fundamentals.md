# Developer Fundamentals

---
## Why??

- These are the topics that are going to be super super short but important because as a beginner it's hard to learn these things because you don't know what you don't know.

- So what I'm going to try and do in these developer fundamentals is tell you well how to avoid the mistakes that I made when I got started and what a lot of people do when they get started

- That is they don't have a clear path and don't understand what the most efficient way to do things is. So with developer fundamentals we're going to talk about key things to make you.

- First of all efficient in learning python but also make you a programmer that is really really good

## 1. Don't read the Dictionary

- When you're learning a language such as Python. You're going to have a tendency especially when you're starting up to try and learn every single thing, every single function every single syntax every single trick but that's now how things work.

---

- As a matter of fact when I work with different programming languages I don't know all the syntax is, I don't know all the methods and functions and what a lot of developers do is not necessarily memorize everything just like you would every single word in a dictionary.

- Instead you understand what exists and what you can use. And you can always google things and most of the time developers are Googling things no matter how experienced they are.

- You have to use the language and you'll notice that some things are used a lot more than others just like in human languages like when you learn English there's really difficult words that don't get used that often.

---

- So we're going to learn the language in a way that makes sense in a way that's efficient where we focus on the 20 percent that gets used 80 percent of the time and all these smaller more complicating things.

- We're going to jump around the idea being that when you learn a programming language you're just using these concepts and slowly you're learning what's out there so that when you have a problem you can identify.

- So your first developer fundamental is this don't learn a language as if you're trying to get 100 percent on a test.
